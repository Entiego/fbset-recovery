			FBSET INSTALLATION GUIDE


Change the current directory to the directory containing the fbset sources and
type

If your phone ARCH is ARM64 (default if you just run make): `make ARCH=aarch64` or just `make`

If your phone ARCH is ARM32: `make ARCH=aarch32`

Either of these will create the `fbset` binary of chosen architecture.

Enjoy!
